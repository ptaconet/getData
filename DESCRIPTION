Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Paul",
           family = "Taconet",

           email = "paul.taconet@ird.fr")
Description: This package contains functions to download
    public domain data, eventually containing spatial and
    temporal components.  Particularly, when web-services are implemented
    by the data provider, it enables to download the data for a specific
    region of interest and/or time frame, hence speeding up the overall
    downloading of data on small regions of
    interest.
