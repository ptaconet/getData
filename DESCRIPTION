    person(given = "Paul",

Description: This package contains functions to download
    and pre-process public domain data, eventually containing spatial and
    temporal components.  Particularly, when web-services are implemented
    by the data provider, it enables to download the data for a specific
    region of interest and/or time frame, hence speeding up the overall
    downloading and pre-processing of data on relatively small regions of
    interest.
